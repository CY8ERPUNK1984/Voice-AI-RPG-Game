### State Management

The application uses a hybrid approach to state management for optimal performance and developer experience:

#### AppContext (Global State)
Centralized React Context API implementation for application-wide state management:

```typescript
interface AppContextState {
  currentStory: Story | null;        // Currently selected story
  gameSession: GameSession | null;   // Active game session
  isConnected: boolean;              // WebSocket connection status
  stories: Story[];                  // Available story scenarios
  storiesLoading: boolean;           // Stories loading state
  offlineMode: boolean;              // Offline mode indicator
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Reducer Pattern**: Predictable state updates with typed actions
- **Convenience Methods**: Simple API for common state operations
- **Connection Awareness**: Real-time connection status tracking
- **Offline Support**: Automatic offline mode detection
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strict typing

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { useApp } from '@/contexts/AppContext';

function GameComponent() {
  const { state, setCurrentStory, setConnectionStatus } = useApp();
  
  // Access global state
  const { currentStory, isConnected, offlineMode } = state;
  
  // Update state
  const handleStorySelect = (story: Story) => {
    setCurrentStory(story);
  };
}
```

#### Component-Level State (Zustand)
Lightweight state management for component-specific state that doesn't need global access.

### AI Services Integration
- **ASR**: Web Speech API (primary) + OpenAI Whisper (fallback) with enhanced audio quality settings
  - Echo cancellation, noise suppression, and auto gain control
  - Optimized 16kHz sample rate for speech recognition
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 for game master responses
- **TTS**: Web Speech API (primary) + OpenAI TTS (premium)

// Wrap your app with AppProvider
import { AppProvider } from '@/contexts/AppContext';

function App() {
  return (
    <AppProvider>
      <YourAppComponents />
    </AppProvider>
  );
}

// Use the context in components
import { useApp } from '@/contexts/AppContext';

function GameComponent() {
  const { state, setCurrentStory, setConnectionStatus } = useApp();
  
  // Access current story, connection status, etc.
  const { currentStory, isConnected, offlineMode } = state;
}
```

### Example Commands
